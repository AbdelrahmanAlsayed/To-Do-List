"# To-Do-List" 
To Do web app has the following features :

- Customizable color scheme: Users can choose from four different color options to customize the appearance of the website. These settings are saved to local storage, so the user's preferred color scheme persists across browser sessions.

- Task creation: Users can create new tasks by entering a task name and clicking a "Add Task" and submit it. This functionality is implemented using an input field.

- Task management: Users can edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete or pending. 

- Clearing tasks: Users can delete all tasks at once by clicking a "Clear All" button. This functionality is implemented using a separate button.
